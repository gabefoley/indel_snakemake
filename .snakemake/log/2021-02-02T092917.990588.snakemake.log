MissingOutputException in line 39 of /Users/gabefoley/Dropbox/PhD/20210121_Indel_Evaluation_Project/Indel_Evaluation_Snakemake/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 1 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
