Error in rule run_grasp:
    jobid: 6
    output: grasp_results/6/fastml/1, grasp_results/6/fastml/1/GRASP_ancestors.fasta, grasp_results/6/fastml/1/tree.nwk

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job run_grasp since they might be corrupted:
grasp_results/6/fastml/1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
