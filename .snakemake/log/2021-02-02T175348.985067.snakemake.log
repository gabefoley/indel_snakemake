rule compile_latex:
    input: plots/plot.tex
    output: plots/plot.pdf
    jobid: 0

[Tue Feb  2 17:53:55 2021]
Error in rule compile_latex:
    jobid: 0
    output: plots/plot.pdf
    shell:
        pdflatex -output-directory plots plots/plot.tex
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job compile_latex since they might be corrupted:
plots/plot.pdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
