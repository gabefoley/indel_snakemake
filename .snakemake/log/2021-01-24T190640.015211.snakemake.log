Waiting at most 30 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 17 of /Users/gabefoley/Dropbox/PhD/20210121_Indel_Evaluation_Project/Indel_Evaluation_Snakemake/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 30 seconds:
indelible_output/40/40_TRUE_13.fas
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 25 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 25
