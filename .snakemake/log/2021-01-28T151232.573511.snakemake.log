Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

	1	all
	3	clean_fasta
	16	concat_fasta
	16	run_grasp
	2	run_indelible

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job run_grasp since they might be corrupted:
grasp_results/20/BEML/2
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
