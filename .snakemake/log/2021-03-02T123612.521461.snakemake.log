Error in rule run_grasp:
    jobid: 1
    output: grasp_results/10/BEML/38, grasp_results/10/BEML/38/GRASP_ancestors.fasta, grasp_results/10/BEML/38/GRASP_ancestors.nwk

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job run_grasp since they might be corrupted:
grasp_results/10/BEML/38
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
