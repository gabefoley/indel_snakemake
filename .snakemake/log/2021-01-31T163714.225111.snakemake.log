Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:

	3	concat_summaries
	1	create_control_files
	1	create_plots

Warning: the following output files of rule run_indelible were not present when the DAG was created:
{'indelible_output/8/8_ANCESTRAL_2.fasta', 'indelible_output/8/8_TRUE_2.fasta'}
Waiting at most 100 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
