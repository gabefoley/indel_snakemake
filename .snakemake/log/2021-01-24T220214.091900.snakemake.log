MissingOutputException in line 23 of /Users/gabefoley/Dropbox/PhD/20210121_Indel_Evaluation_Project/Indel_Evaluation_Snakemake/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
cleaned_output/80/80_tree_2.nwk
cleaned_output/80/80_TRUE_2_cols_removed.fasta
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
